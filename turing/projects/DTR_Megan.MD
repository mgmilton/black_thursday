### Template for DTR Memo

Project: Black Thursday

Group Member Names: Megan McMahon and Matt Milton

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

We both expect to get through the basic requirements (iterations 1-3, option 4 or 5). Aim to hit all of the aspects detailed in the rubric (ie. a commit an hour, utilize waffle.io, and pull request). We both want to do a thorough job testing ensuring that we test for edge cases. test each linkage/chain (find out what this means). Matt hopes that we get 3's in each category.

Team strengths:

Megan is really good at thinking logically through problems and keeping the big picture in focus.

Matt is direct and honest in communicating, and is punctual.


Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):

Generally work schedule ends at 7pm on weekdays.

Tuesday 1/2 - Megan has a mentoring session (5:45-6:30pm)
Wednesday 1/3 - OPEN
Thursday 1/4 - Megan is having dinner with parents (must be done by 7:00pm)
Friday 1/5 - OPEN
Saturday 1/6 - Megan is busy until (12:00pm)
Sunday 1/7 - OPEN
Monday 1/8 - OPEN
Tuesday 1/9 - OPEN
Wednesday 1/10 - Aim to have working product finished by Wednesday morning.
Thursday 1/11 - Due at 9:00 am

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):

Megan feels communication should be continuous and natural. Matt concurs. Slack works well for communication. If canceling, call the other partner.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Matt hopes to improve on github pull request protocol, and it would be nice to have a fast test suite. Megan wants to try commit at every pomodoro break (~25 min), correspondingly take pomodoro breaks. Matt feel as a team we are technically proficient.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

Start the project together and then divide and conquer. When work is completed by the other's partner, ensure that both partners are up to speed on the code. Best case scenario is that each partner can confidently speak about all the code.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):

Ideally, utilize test-driven development as a process as much as possible.

GitHub - two commits per hour, each feature utilizes a pull requests (target range: 10-15 prs), every time independent work is completed then have the code reviewed and pull requests reviewed as a team upon meeting again.

Tools - Rake, SimpleCov, Waffle.io

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Let's agree to discuss conflicts as they occur and not to sit on them, letting them fester. All feedback should actionable - come to the table with solutions not problems. Keep the rapport as positive as possible.

Agenda to discuss project launch:

Ideas: Start the project together then delegate tasks.


Tools: Rake, SimpleCov, Waffle.io


Additional Notes:

Matt encourages team members to stay hydrated and satiated.
